# Rubik-s-Cube-OpenGL
A graphical Rubik's Cube Solver with python and OpenGL

Only the Beginner Method is available

How to use it :
  - make sure you have python3+ installed
  - got to repo (with terminal/cmd)
  - type: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
  - to run it: 'python main.py'

What I want to implement:
  - fix a bug (which rarely occurs) which makes the program 'freeze' (it's not freeezing, it's running an infinite while loop)
  - more than 3x3 Cubes (2x2, 4x4, etc.)
  - BLD Solving
  - More complex (and fast) methods for RC solving
